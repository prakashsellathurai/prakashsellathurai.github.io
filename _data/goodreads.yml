  desc: 'This volume helps take some of the "mystery" out of identifying and dealing
    with key algorithms. Drawing heavily on the author''s own real-world experiences,
    the book stresses design and analysis. Coverage is divided into two parts, the
    first being a general guide to techniques for the design and analysis of computer
    algorithms. The second is a reference section, which includes a catalog of the
    75 most important algorithmic problems. By browsing this catalog, readers can
    quickly identify what the problem they have encountered is called, what is known
    about it, and how they should proceed if they need to solve it. This book is ideal
    for the working professional who uses algorithms on a daily basis and has need
    for a handy reference. This work can also readily be used in an upper-division
    course or as a student reference guide. THE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL comes with
    a CD-ROM that contains: * a complete hypertext version of the full printed book.
    * the source code and URLs for all cited implementations. * over 30 hours of audio
    lectures on the design and analysis of algorithms are provided, all keyed to on-line
    lecture notes.'

    and in the darkeness bind them<br /><br />In ancient times the Rings of Power
    were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, The Dark Lord, forged the One Ring,
    filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring
    was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained
    lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told
    in The Hobbit.<br /><br />In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins

  desc: "In the highly anticipated <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>, Kahneman takes\
    \ us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive\
    \ the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower,\
    \ more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities\u2014\
    and also the faults and biases\u2014of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive\
    \ influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact\
    \ of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties\
    \ of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly\
    \ framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on\
    \ everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation\u2014\
    each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together\
    \ to shape our judgments and decisions.<br /><br />Engaging the reader in a lively\
    \ conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust\
    \ our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers\
    \ practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business\
    \ and our personal lives\u2014and how we can use different techniques to guard\
    \ against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. <i>Thinking, Fast\
    \ and Slow</i> will transform the way you think about thinking."

- author: Steven D. Levitt
  desc: 'Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers
    and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?
    How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on
    violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern
    world.<br /><br />These may not sound like typical questions for an economist
    to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded
    scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and
    crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the
    conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and
    a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues;
    others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained
    in this book: freakonomics.<br /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight,
    Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study
    of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other
    people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the
    hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth
    about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of
    a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites
    all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation,
    complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and
    -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think.
    All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever
    and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.<br /><br />Freakonomics
    establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like
    the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is
    true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to
    last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that.
    It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br />(front flap)'

    \ shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly,\
    \ but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon\

    \ happier people.<br /><br />For decades, we\u2019ve been told that positive thinking\
    \ is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"\
    Let\u2019s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly\
    \ popular Internet blog, Manson doesn\u2019t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells\
    \ it like it is\u2014a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking\
    \ today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling,\
    \ let\u2019s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled\
    \ a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br /><br\
    \ />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed\
    \ poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons\
    \ into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed\
    \ and limited\u2014\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and\
    \ losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises\
    \ us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears,\
    \ faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting\
    \ painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility,\
    \ curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br /><br />There are only so many things\
    \ we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter,\
    \ Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your\
    \ life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye\
    \ moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless\
    \ humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for\
