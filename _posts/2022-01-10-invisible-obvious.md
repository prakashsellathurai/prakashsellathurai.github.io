when Nicolaus Copernicus proposed his [Copernican heliocentrism](https://dbpedia.org/page/Copernican_heliocentrism), The Notion that the Sun is the center of the universe may sounded  bizarre to the people who believed earth as the centre.Later that was further superseded with the development of the Cosmological principle[^1].

when the Modern Astronomers discovered new galaxies than our Milky way and experimental  proof of  Evidence for the Universe Expansion, resulted in the understanding that, the concept of centre of the universe is  meaningless in ever expanding universe, independant of any fixed point. 

During the mid of 19th century, Planck was told by his professor, the field of theoretical physics is almost approaching the degree of perfection as if geometry has been for centuries, all that left is  followup works[^2].

Development of Quantum theory fundamentally shifted our  understanding of the  physics,which solved well known problems known physicist for years.These contributions led to the dawn of new age of physics hence, the period between 1925 and 1927, is considered as The golden age of Physics[^4].

In Educational Instituitions, Everyone is led to believe, as if Important problems ever existed has been already  figured out and solved.To succeed in one's career,one just need to do minor improvements from existing  solutions. For them it's silly to  take big bets on Important problems. 

if importance vs risk (i.e possibilty that the work will  be done) is plotted on a 2d graph.people chose to stay in lower left quadrant of the graph.what they miss, there is always certain sweetspots where  risk is less and the problem have more importance.

In most cases, people miss these because of their custom of processing the information from the generally accepted standards.It takes courage to solve a problem in unconventional way.

Discovering the right way of how universe works is as rare and, important as predicting the future risks of an impending danger.The danger could be anything from the systematic risk of financial instability to the outbreak of deadly virus. 

Most Doomsayers were wrong and some of them made right predictions long before it  happens.Not everyone sees the risk until it happens to them,some of them made bluff. Richard A.Clarke proposed a method named "The Cassandra Coefficient" in his book "Warnings", to separate accurate predictions of danger from the inaccurate doomsayers.

It's a pretty neat framwork considers The warning, the threat or risk in question, the decision makers or audience who must react,The predictor or possible Cassandra, and The critics who disparage or reject the warning[^3].

He outlined "Invisible Obvious"  as one of the factors under key characteristics for identifying the Cassandra events,sometimes what people takes for granted is where the worst risk is at.Doomsayers aka Cassandras  forsees those risk before it happens.one must have be open to unorthodox intrepretations  to come up with pretty non intuitive insights.

It doesn't mean one must hopelessly search, far beyond the bounds of possibility.as always there is a thin line that separates the impossible  from invisible obvious.It's no easy task, to take a path that has been never explored.

Invisible obvious are not just the list of interesting facts,it's more of the invisble fundamental truths where no one else cared to look, that unravels much more deeper meaning of an Idea.one such  truth is there is still a lot of invisible-obvious to invent,discover,hack and explore.

If one want to excel , one must start looking for the hidden obvious.
