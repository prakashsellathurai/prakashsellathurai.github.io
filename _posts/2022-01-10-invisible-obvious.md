Most People used to presume the Earth as the centre of the Universe. It sounded bizarre to others when Nicolaus Copernicus came up with 
[Copernican heliocentrism](https://dbpedia.org/page/Copernican_heliocentrism). His model positioned the sun as the centre of the Universe. Later, the development of the Cosmological principle[^1] went one step further.

Technological advancements helped us discover many galaxies than our milky-way, where Copernicus couldn't. The Experimental Evidence proved the theory that Universe is expanding. The isotropic and homogenous nature of Universe Expansion led us to conclude, Universe has no centre.

Once Planck's professor told him that the field of physics is approaching the degree of perfection, as geometry has been for centuries. All that is left is follow-up works[^2]. He was wrong.

The Quantum theory, Electromagnetism, and General Relativity shifted our understanding of the Universe. These contributions led to the dawn of the new age of Physics. The number of Great works happened from 1925 to 1927. those years are known as the golden age of Physics[^4].

Social Norm dictates us, all of our existing problems were solved already. To ensure career progress in the conventional world,  It's enough for one to make minor improvements to existing solutions. Anyone willing to take big bets on Important problems is considered silly. 

If the Importance of an Idea and its Risk (i.e. possibility) is plotted on a 2d graph. People chose to stay in the lower left quadrant of the graph. What most people overlook is, there are always sweet spots with less risk and more importance.

People fail to recognize these sweet spots because of their conformed thinking. It takes courage and curiosity to access an idea from the most opposite point of view.

Discovering the Right interpretation of an Idea is as rare and important as predicting the future risks of an Impending danger. The danger could be anything, from the systematic risk of financial instability to the outbreak of a deadly virus. 

Most Doomsayers were wrong some of them made the Right predictions long before it happen. Not everyone sees the risk until it happens to them, some of them made bluff. Richard A.Clarke proposed "The Cassandra Coefficient" in his book "Warnings" to separate accurate predictions of danger from inaccurate ones[^3].

"Invisible Obvious" is one of the key characteristics for estimating risk in the Cassandra Coefficient. Sometimes, what people take for granted is where the worst risk is at. Doomsayers (aka Cassandras) foresee those risks before they happen. one must be open to unorthodox interpretations to come up with such non-intuitive insights.

It doesn't mean one must hopelessly search, far beyond the bounds of possibility. Remember,  there is always a thin line that separates the impossible from the invisible obvious. It's not easy to take a path that has never been explored. Be sure to know when to exploit and when to explore.

Invisible obvious are not just the list of interesting facts. It's the fundamental truths where no one else cared/dared to look, that unravels the much deeper meaning. one such truth is there is still a lot of invisible-obvious to invent, discover, hack and explore.

If one wants to excel, one must start looking for the hidden obvious.
