Invisible obvious is the truth or an idea invisible or too naive to be accepted  as truth. sometimes  people choose to ignore it.This may seem counter-intuitive at first. The idea that Earth is the center of the universe made obsolete by Nicolaus Copernicus with his [Copernican heliocentrism](https://dbpedia.org/page/Copernican_heliocentrism).During the mid of 19th century,planck was told by his professor, the field of theoretical physics is almost approaching the degree of perfection as if geometry has been for centuries, all that left is  followup works[^1].In fact lot of scientific breakthrough especially in theoretical physics happened in the early 20th century resulted in the rise of modern physics for example,theory of relativity,Quantum mechanics etc.

According to Greek Myth,Apollo  cursed the Cassandra with the knowledge of true prophecies,but not to be believed by others.she foresaw the fall of troy,but people of troy ignored her led to their destruction.

Most Doomsayer's predictions were inaccurate, Richard A.Clarke proposed a method named "The Cassandra Coefficient", to separate accurate predictions of danger from the inaccurate doomsayers[^2].“The most important discoveries, the greatest art, and the best management decisions come from taking a fresh look at what people take for granted or cannot see precisely because it is too obvious.”
