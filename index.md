**Bio:**

I am a professional software engineer with work experience in computer vision and full-stack development. Previously, I worked as a software engineer at GKFIT and as a computer vision engineer at Bigthinx. 

In 2019, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechatronics engineering from Anna University. In 2018, I co-founded an e-commerce platform ClothX (now archived).

Software engineering, Information Theory, Digital control and Electromechanical control systems interest me. Often I build automation projects and software tools as a hobby.
