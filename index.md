<p>
I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> from an interdisciplinary(Mechatronics) background primarily focused on Computer Vision, and Python, with a solid foundation in coding, testing, code reviews and other software engineering practices.
</p>

<p>
 In the past, I worked as a software engineer at GKFIT and a computer vision engineer at Bigthinx. 
In 2018, I co-founded an e-commerce platform ClothX (now archived). As of 2019, I have earned my undergraduate degree in Mechatronics engineering from Anna University.
</p>
<p>
My interests lie in the fields of software engineering, information theory, digital control, and electromechanical control systems. I enjoy building automation projects and developing software.
