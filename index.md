<p style=" display: inline;">Hello!  I'm <h1 style="font-style: inherit;font-size: inherit;display: inline">Prakash</h1></p>

<p>
I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with background in computer vision and fullstack engineering.

<p>
 In the past, I worked as a software engineer at GKFIT and a computer vision engineer at Bigthinx. 
In 2018, I co-founded an e-commerce platform ClothX (now archived). As of 2019, I have earned my undergraduate degree in Mechatronics engineering from Anna University.

Software engineering, Information Theory, Digital control and Electromechanical control systems interest me. As a hobby, I often build automation projects and software tools.
